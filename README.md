# responsive-portfolio
I used the bootstrap navbar, added a dark theme. Applied background image to the body which was much less painful than I expected. Used the bootstrap grid to make all the windows and assets do what i wanted. Setting the image sizes in the style sheet for some reason made them uncooperative with the responsive page. All the pages take up 2/3 of the screen on large monitors, and the whole width on smaller screens. Getting dropdown to work was difficult until i dove deeper into the bootstrap and saw i needed to link a js bootstrap. The contact page will accept your inputs but the submit button just resets it. I don't quite know how php works yet and I wasn't looking to network just yet. 

Overall, the things I thought would be very difficult gave me minimal trouble thanks to bootstrap, and simple things cost me hours. I think I am definitely more suited to back end.

I am glad to have bought so much alcohol before the quarantine.
